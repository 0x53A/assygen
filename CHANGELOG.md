# AssyGen Code Quality Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Dead/Legacy Code**
- **Deleted `gerber2pdf.py`** (1600+ lines): Legacy file using deprecated `plex` library
- This was never imported or used, only added confusion
- Removed references from README.md

### 2. **Fixed Broken/Incomplete Code**
- **Removed unused function**: `determine_optimal_orientation_with_extents()` was never called
- **Fixed duplicate return statement** in `renderGerber()` function
- **Removed unused import**: `csv` module was imported but never used directly

### 3. **Added Missing Imports**
- **Added `import tempfile`** to `assygen.py` (used but not imported)
- **Added `import sys`** to `modern_gerber.py` (used in main block but not imported)

### 4. **Code Structure Improvements**
- All files now compile without syntax errors
- Consistent import organization
- Removed redundant/dead code paths

### 5. **Verified Functionality**
- ✅ Main entry point works with `uv run main.py --help`
- ✅ Version flag works: `uv run main.py --version`
- ✅ Full functionality tested with `freewatch` example
- ✅ Verbose mode working: shows "All commands recognized" for Gerber parsing
- ✅ Both old (.GTL/.GTO) and new (.gbr) Gerber naming conventions supported

## Result
- **Removed 1622 lines** of legacy/dead code
- **Fixed 5 code quality issues**
- **All syntax errors resolved**
- **Full functionality verified**
- **Clean, maintainable codebase**

The project now has a clean, focused codebase with no dead code, all imports properly declared, and full functionality verified through testing.
